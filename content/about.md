I am **Stella Shu Ting Wong**. My academic background is in law and social science. I am particularly interested in the nexus between **human rights and the environment**, **sustainable (international and local) development**, as well as **Business & Human Rights**.

Having recently relocated to Ireland, I am **available for work** and seeking to contribute to non-profit projects. If you have any leads or are interested in working with me, email me at shuwong.stella@gmail.com or let's connect [on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stella-shu-t-wong/)!

When I'm not working, I volunteer for some **community and public interest projects**, both locally and globally (see the [Community page](/Community/)). And I just enjoy the craic -- hiking, pixel art and watercolour painting.
