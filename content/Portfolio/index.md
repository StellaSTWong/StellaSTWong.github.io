# Capacity Building & Knowledge Exchange

I develop and deliver training on human rights-related topics. I am also keen to learn from others, whether through informal discussions or at conferences.

**Example: Speaking on a panel at the Annual International Conference of the Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) 2021**

**Example: Knowledge exchange, brainstorming and strategising in relation to responsible investment/ Business & Human Rights in the extractive industries in Southeast Asia and East Asia back in 2018**

I was grateful for the opportunity to interact with and learn from a few Indigenous community members from Ratanakiri province of Cambodia, among others. It's a very humbling experience.

**Example: Content development for the course "Child and Forced Labour Prevention" for EcoVadis's online [academy](https://support.ecovadis.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408733173266-What-is-included-in-the-EcoVadis-Academy)** - The training is aimed at companies and their business partners. Unfortunately, due to the private nature of the Academy, I am unable to share the curriculum or content here.

# Research & Writing

I have conducted research and written about human rights and labour rights while working in various settings.

**Example: Conference paper on "Voluntary codes and the impact on human rights and labour rights" presented at the Global Business & Human Rights Scholars Association Annual Conference 2019** ([Link to the abstract](https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/publications/voluntary-codes-and-the-impact-on-human-rights-amp-labour-rights/))

**Example: Policy submissions to UN bodies and mechanisms on topics including [just transition and human rights](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/issues/ohchr-cfis/transition/subm-just-transition-hr-cso-global-ne-gnhre-nhre.pdf) as well as [democracy and climate change](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/forums/forum-demoracy-ruleoflaw/2025/subm-5-session-forum-non-orga-4-global-gnhre-nhre.pdf)**

**Example: My master's thesis: Exploring corporate responsibility for climate change loss and damage in the global pursuit of climate justice** *(written for the seminar ["Environmental Damage"](https://www.ivr.uzh.ch/en/institutsmitglieder/keller/Seminars/Seminare.html) at the University of Zurich, supervised by the team of Prof. Helen Keller, former judge at the European Court of Human Rights, and Dr. Corina Heri)*

The world has witnessed what scholar Maxine Burkett described as a “justice paradox”: there is a lack of just solutions under the existing international legal regime for victims of climate change impacts “who are the most vulnerable yet the least responsible.”

In my thesis, I examined how international climate change law and human rights law have responded to (and failed to respond to) the question of responsibility of business enterprises in the context of climate change-related loss and damage. I also explored the emerging avenues to seek climate justice, including climate litigation in certain jurisdictions.


# Public Awareness/Education (and visual communication)

I facilitate awareness-raising and (informal) educational programmes and events. I also develop visual communication materials, such as posters.

**Example: Public webinar on the human rights implications of the International Court of Justice's Advisory Opinion on climate change** ([Link to the event page](https://gnhre.org/?p=18433))
