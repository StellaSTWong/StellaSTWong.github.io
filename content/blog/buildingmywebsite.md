Technically speaking, I'm not a techie. I built my website by playing with Hugo (and Markdown and stuff like that) and using tools like Git Bash and Visual Studio Code. It's all *learning by doing*. The thing is, since I don't code on regularly, I simply forget things. So here's a quick brain dump and bookmarking (just so I can pick things up more quickly later on)!

## Resources on markdown:

+ basic markdown guide ([link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)) 
+ workarounds for things that are not officially supported by Markdown e.g. adding comments and underlining texts. ([link](https://www.markdownguide.org/hacks/))
