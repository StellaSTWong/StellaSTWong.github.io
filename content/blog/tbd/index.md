Taiwan to Mandate Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) ⚖️

The Taiwanese Ministry of Economic Affairs has released the Draft Program for Enterprises to Respect Human Rights in the Supply Chains《臺灣企業供應鏈尊重人權方案》. This initiative is a significant step to align Taiwan with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).

Listed companies in the manufacturing sector with annual turnover exceeding NT$50 billion in the preceding year will be required to: 🏭
💡conduct HRDD on their own operations and direct suppliers/business partners within their supply chains; and
💡disclose HRDD implementation in their sustainability reports. 

HRDD process includes:
✅ establishing an enterprise human rights policy;
✅ assessing adverse human rights impacts;
✅ taking action on assessment findings;
✅ tracking the effectiveness of actions taken;
✅ communicating and disclosing the handling procedures; and
✅ establishing internal grievance mechanisms.

📅 The mandatory HRDD implementation is expected to take place from 2026, with disclosure required within the 2027 sustainability report.

The Program is subject to review based on implementation results and global trends, with possibility of scope expansion.

Note📑: Taiwan is also concurrently developing the Draft National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights 2.0《臺灣企業與人權國家行動計畫》and the Draft Guidelines for Enterprises to Respect Human Rights in the Supply Chains《臺灣供應鏈企業尊重人權指引》.
