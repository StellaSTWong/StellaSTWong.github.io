In recent years, I have come across quite a few news articles and reports about the (in)effectiveness of carbon offset projects and their impact on communities and Indigenous Peoples. 

# What's going on?

[*Article 6 of the Paris Agreement*](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/article6) allows and regulates a few tools for countries to "collaborate" with each other to meet their National Determined Contributions (NDCs), including through bilateral trading of emission reduction credits, among other things. But Article 6 does not directly regulate the voluntary carbon market, which is widely used by non-state actors (e.g. companies), nor does it provide any requirements for carbon credit quality in such a market.

Carbon offset projects have flourished over the last decade or so. This raises questions about their effectiveness, as well as a myriad of social and environmental issues. For instance, [in 2023, The Guardian examined](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe) some rainforest carbon offset projects that had been certified by Verra, a global carbon standard organisation. Their analysis found that only a handful of these projects demonstrated a reduction in deforestation, based on two studies, while over 90% of the issued credits failed to benefit the climate.

Some project developers have been labelled ["carbon cowboys"](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/15/money-carbon-credits-zimbabwe-conservation-aoe) for reaping monetary benefits while disregarding the significant social impact on local communities. Journalists and civil society organisations have documented human rights abuses, ranging from the [violent forced eviction of the forest communities of Alto Mayo in Peru](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/forest-communities-alto-mayo-peru-carbon-offsetting-aoe) to [violations of the rights of Cambodia's Chong Indigenous People in the Southern Cardamom REDD+ project](https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/02/29/carbon-offsettings-casualties/violations-chong-indigenous-peoples-rights).


Even if a carbon offset project is effective, questions remain. For example, who is entitled to the benefits generated by reducing carbon emissions through carbon trading? Who can decide how, to whom, and under what circumstances carbon is sold? Understanding the concept of **carbon rights** is thus pivotal. When it comes to questions about who *should* benefit and how carbon trading *should* be conducted, the **principles of carbon justice and climate justice** come into play.

# What are carbon rights?

Currently, there is no internationally agreed, standard definition of carbon rights. The [UN Food and Agriculture Organization](https://www.fao.org/redd/news/detail/en/c/1538781/) defines the concept as comprising two key elements: (1) **the property rights to sequester and store carbon, contained in land, trees, soil, etc.**; and (2) **the right to benefits that arise from the transfer of these property rights e.g. through carbon trading**. 

According to a report by the [Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI) and McGill University](https://rightsandresources.org/wp-content/uploads/Carbon-Rights-Report_Final-rev-05-2025-1.pdf), a broader definition is needed (and adopted in the report). This definition encompasses not only the legal claim to benefits, but also **"the full bundle of rights that Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendant Peoples, and local communities, including the women within these groups, may exercise over their *lands and resources*, as well as the broader set of *community rights* that are central to any effectual safeguard system."**

As an article by the [International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) notes, many of these projects are land-based projects and currently span 24 million hectares](https://www.iisd.org/articles/deep-dive/land-justice-social-equity-carbon-markets) -- almost the size of Uganda. Local communities and Indigenous Peoples are often the custodians of land and related natural resources, with or without land title. Therefore, land tenure and land rights of communities are inextricably linked to carbon rights.

Despite the importance of the topic, the abovementioned report by RRI and McGill University reveals that the majority of the 33 countries examined across Africa, Asia, and Latin America have failed to put in place the necessary legal and policy reforms to recognise and protect the carbon rights of Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendant Peoples, and local communities.

# What would justice look like in this context? 

Carbon-related projects are very likely here to stay. In my humble opinion, carbon justice means that all such projects must respect human rights and treat all rights holders equally, particularly marginalised groups such as indigenous peoples. This is just the floor, not the ceiling. 

More crucial criteria have been suggested and articulated in the *Carbon Justice Principles of the Grassroots Justice Network* and the *Climate Justice Principles of the Mary Robinson Foundation*.

### Carbon Justice Principles

The *Grassroots Justice Network* advocates a set of [Carbon Justice Principles](https://grassrootsjusticenetwork.org/carbon-justice-movement/):

### Principles of Climate Justice developed by the *Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice*

These [principles](https://www.mrfcj.org/principles-of-climate-justice/) are highly relevant not only to carbon offset projects, but also to any climate-related projects, developments or investments.

+ Respect and Protect **Human Rights**
+ Support the **Right to Development**
+ **Share Benefits and Burdens** Equitably
+ Ensure that Decisions on Climate Change are **Participatory, Transparent and Accountable**
+ Highlight **Gender Equality and Equity**
+ Harness the Transformative Power of **Education** for climate stewardship
+ Use Effective **Partnerships** to Secure Climate Justice
