With conflicts taking place every day not very far from home, I have decided to write this post to organise and share some essential resources on the *basics* of international humanitarian law, operational standards for humanitarian responses, and relevant Business & Human Rights responsibilities. Most of them are free and accessible to the public.

# Core Humanitarian Standard (CHS) on Quality and Accountability

**The Core Humanitarian Standards on Quality and Accountability (CHS)** ([web](https://www.corehumanitarianstandard.org/)) is a widely recognised standard governing humanitarian action, published by the CHS Alliance, Group URD and Sphere Association. The CHS (updated in 2024) outlines nine commitments and core elements of an accountable and quality humanitarian response. It should be used in conjunction with **[the Sphere Handbook](https://spherestandards.org/handbook-2018/)** (2018).

Under each commitment, there are detailed requirements. The full text (available in various languagues) can be accessed [here](https://www.corehumanitarianstandard.org/languages).

### Training resources
+ [short online course "Introduction to the CHS (2024)"](https://kayaconnect.org/course/view.php?id=11672) offered by *Kaya* (a platform for learning about humanitarian topics)

# SPHERE Handbook (2018 edition)

I mentioned the Sphere Handbook ([interactive version](https://handbook.spherestandards.org/en/sphere/#ch001)) above. It is a comprehensive handbook for humanitarian action. It comprises **the Humanitarian Charter**, **the Protection Principles** and **minimum humanitarian standards** (note the Core Humanitarian Standard 2024). It covers four important areas of humanitarian response:
+ water supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion (WASH)
+ food security and nutrition
+ shelter and settlement
+ health

# International Humanitarian Law (IHL)

I have studied international law before, both at undergraduate and post-graduate levels. International humanitarian law, alongside human rights law, is always something interesting to me.

+ IHL is **jus in bello**, also known as the law of war or armed conflict (cf. jus ad bellum).
+ It's a set of rules that aims to **limit the effects of armed conflict**.
+ It applies regardless of the reason or justification for resorting to armed conflict or war.
+ The sources of IHL include treaty law and customary law.
+ The main IHL treaties are the **four Geneva Conventions of 1949** and the two **Additional Protocols of 1979** (together containing almost 600 articles).
+ ICRC's 2005 study also identified **161 rules of customary IHL** ([Full text](https://www.icrc.org/sites/default/files/external/doc/en/assets/files/other/customary-international-humanitarian-law-i-icrc-eng.pdf)).

### Resources on IHL: databases and introdutory training

+ *The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)*'s website provides a wealth of resources and information, particularly the [IHL Databases](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/). ICRC have also rolled out a cool **mobile app** ([web](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/ihl-digital-app)), on which you can easily find the relevant treaties and documents relating to IHL.
+ *Kaya* (a platform for learning about humanitarian topics) offers a **free online course**: ["Introduction to International Humanitarian Law (IHL)"](https://kayaconnect.org/course/view.php?id=1284).
+ *Leiden University* also offers a slightly more advanced **online course** titled ["International Humanitarian Law in Theory and Practice"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/international-humanitarian-law) on Coursera (note: it's a paid course).

# Nexus between conflict, human rights and the role/responsibility of business

The [United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf) provide a normative framework that guides state duties and business responsibilities with respect to human rights.
 > The Commentary to Principle 12 of the UNGPs: *[I]n situations of armed conflict, enterprises should **respect the standards of international humanitarian law**.*
 > 
 > Principle 7 of the UNGPs: *Because **the risk of gross human rights abuses is heightened** in conflict-affected areas, States should help ensure that business enterprises operating in those contexts are not involved with such abuses, including by... **[e]nsuring that their current policies, legislation, regulations and enforcement measures are effective** in addressing the risk of business involvement in gross human rights abuses.*
