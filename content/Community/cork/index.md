Not sure where to start with sustainable living? Here are some selected places and community projects in and around Cork that I'm either involved in or, if not, curious to explore. Hope this list gives you some ideas to get started! (And it is by no means exhaustive.)


### As friends of nature

+ **Nature Network Ireland** ([web](https://naturenetworkireland.ie/)): They're doing some great community-based nature conservation and education projects in and around Cork City and beyond. For example, I've been volunteering for [the Beaumont Quarry project](https://naturenetworkireland.ie/what-we-do/restoring-nature/beaumont-quarry/), which is about regenerating and conserving the limestone quarry-turned wildlife area. (Keep an eye out for bats and foxes!)

+ **Community gardens**:  I was gifted a tomato plant by a community garden this year and it yielded juicy, bright red tomatoes in the backyard! It's a great way to get to know our neighbours too. Fancy volunteering for or visiting a local community garden? Here's a [map](https://corkhealthycities.com/greenspacesforhealth/cork-community-network-map/ "Cork Community Gardens Network Map 2025 by Cork Healthy Cities") showing where you can find these gardens in Cork. It appears there are at least **25** community gardens in the city.

+ **Cork Healthy Cities/ Green Spaces for Health** ([web](https://corkhealthycities.com/greenspacesforhealth/)): Green Spaces for Health is an interesting initiative comprising a number of community-based green space projects. For instance, they have transformed a former cemetery into a small public park called Parkowen in South Parish ([map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u51LGaSjsh4tjYEGA)). Having visited the site, it's lovely to see first-hand the efforts made to rewild and revive the area with different species of plant. They welcome volunteers, too.

+ **Clean Coasts** ([web](https://cleancoasts.org/)): The programme supports communities in carrying out beach clean-ups and facilitates marine litter surveys and other eco-friendly activities. For instance, the annual [Big Beach Clean](https://cleancoasts.org/our-initiatives/big-beach-clean/) is one such event, with some communities in Cork participating.

+ **The Environmental Forum** ([web](https://environmentalforum.ie/)): They organise a variety of environmentally-related [activities](https://environmentalforum.ie/projects/events/) in Cork City and County Cork, including workshops, walking tours and Bike Week cycling. I joined one of their walking tours, which was a good way to learn about the surrounding environment and its history.

### As eco-conscious eaters and consumers

+ **Cork Repair Café** ([web](https://corkrepaircafe.org/)): Before buying something new, why not try repairing what we have first? The repair café normally runs once a month. It's hosted either by Rebel Reads bookstore ([web](https://www.rebelreads.ie/)) or the Lough Community Centre ([map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SV61MyjMuERHs5AKA)).

+ **Food and groceries**: 
    + I'd definitely recommend the lovely locally-produced, chemical-free **vegetables** from one of the stalls at the *Coal Quay Saturday Market* ([map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gU2N1hN99PGJtfL88)) (the stall closest to Grand Parade). They always have what's in season! Saturday only.
    + *Quay Co-op* ([map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VAojAQRwxuBoNhch9)) is a great place to get **organic grains and legumes** in bulk and to refill **plant-based washing up/laundry liquid** - zero waste! Just bring your own containers. There's also a good range of **organic flour, nuts, herbs** and a lot more (like **miso and peanut butter**!) to choose from. 
    + **Plant-based black pudding?**: Yes! I found it! Shoot me an email and I'll give you a tip.

+ **Second-hand shops**: 
    + If you're looking to give some of your **clothes** a new home or find some vintage items for yourself, there are several charity shops on *North Main Street*, as well as a couple more tucked away on *Cook Street* and *Princes Street*. 
    + For used  **furniture**, there's a big store to the east of the Marina Market.
